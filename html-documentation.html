        <header><h2>Introduction to HTML</h2></header>
          <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the primary language used to create web pages, and is read by web browsers in order to display specific content, defined by the code in the HTML. It was invented in 1991 by a man named Tim Berners-Lee, who was also responsible for the invention of the World Wide Web itself, in 1989.
          </p>
          <p>At its heart, HTML is a fairly simple language made up of elements, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. 
          </p>
          <p>In order to write HTML documents, all you need is a computer, and a simple text editor.
          </p>

        <header><h2>HTML editors</h2></header>
        <p>Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors, however, all you really need is a text editor such as Notepad for PC, or TextEdit for Mac. Both of these text editors can be found pre-installed on their associated devices.
        </p>
        <p>If you would like to become more involved with writing HTML code, and other computer languages, there are plenty of very good dedicated code writing programs to choose from. These include:
        </p>
        <ul id="editors">
          <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
          <li>Atom</li>
          <li>Sublime Text</li>
          <li>Notepad++</li>
          <li>Vim</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      
      <section class="main-section" id="elements">
        <header><h2>Elements</h2></header>
        <p>An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. The tag types are specific to the nature of the content between them, and are formatted in a particular way. A start tag begins with a "less than" symbol (&lt;), and ends with a "greater than" symbol (&gt;). An end tag has the same format, but includes a forward slash (/) after the tag name, and before the (&gt;) symbol.
        </p>
        <p>Elements are categorised by the type of tags that are used to define their content. This categorisation can then be used to style the web page to virtually any specification, using tools such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Some of the main tags that you will use within the main content of an HTML document are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul id="tag-list">
          <li><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>: These tags classify their associated elements as headings, with 1 being the most important (usually the main heading), down to 6 being the least important sub-headings.</li>
          <li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code>: This tag is used to group blocks of content into paragrapghs, so it is distinguishable form headings, other paragraghs, and other elements.</li>
          <li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code>: </li>
          <li><code>&lt;main&gt;</code>: This HTML tag represents the dominant content of the page of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.</li>
        </ul>
